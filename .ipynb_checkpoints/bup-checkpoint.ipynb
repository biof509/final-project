    "Plasmids can be difficult to distinguish from chromosomes in bacterial assemblies. They often require careful study of annotation and closed circular assemblies to be confident of their status as replicon independent of the chromosome. This problem is particularly pronounced in short-read assemblies where chromosomal contigs and plasmids contigs can be of similar size. Long read assemblies can also contain  contigs of transposable elements, phage, and chromosomal regions that did not close in the assembly graph that are of similar size to typical plasmids. I hope to be able to create a model that can differentiate between chromosome and plasmid DNA based upon differential bias in sequence composition between the replicon types. "
